# Online-Shopping-Cart
This project uses C++ to create a virtual shopping cart. You are able to use it for adding items, removing items, changing the quantity of items, getting the number of items in the cart, getting the cost of individual items or the entire cart, and list the items currently in the cart. You can also check the customer name and the current date.
